step 1: make the background like netflix and have it fade

step 2: add netflix logo (see logo.svg)

step 3: position netflix logo by adding class  and also width and height to the css. see nav a.logo, nav img, and header nav in style.css

step 4: sign in. make it white and give it a default font if the font you want isn't available. add box sizing that tells the browser not to calculate margins.

step 5:
see pitch, pitch title, and pitch subtitle in style.css to see new changes to the heading.

step 6:
see btn for how styling the red join now button and nav .signin:hover .btn:hover to change the button when you hover.

step 7: add three features at the bottom with flex box

step 8: see the js file for making the three rows responsive. screens now change when you switch to "watch anywhere" or "pick your price"
