# netflix

step 1: make the background like netflix and have it fade
body{
  margin: 0;
}

header{
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0,0,0,0.9), rgba(0,0,0,0.05)), url('../img/background-netflix-header.jpg');
  height: 100vh;
}

step 2: add netflix logo (see logo.svg)

step 3: position netflix logo by adding class a and additing width and height to the css. see nav a.logo, nav img, and header nav in style.css


step 4: sign in. make it white and give it a default font if the font you want isn't available. add box sizing that tells the browser not to calculate margins.
